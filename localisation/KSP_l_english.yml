 EMPIRE_DESIGN_xenomorph_swarm_desc: "Xenomorph is a highly aggressive endoparasitoid extraterrestrial species. The Xenomorphs are vicious predatory creatures with no higher goals than the propagation of their species and the destruction of any life that could pose a threat to them. Like wasps or bees, Xenomorphs are eusocial, with a fertile Queen breeding a host of subordinate castes. The creatures are known for their potent acidic blood and their pharyngeal jaws, although their biological life cycle, in which their offspring are implanted inside living hosts before erupting violently from their chests, is in many ways their signature aspect.~"

 KSP_mun_category: "[Root.GetName] Anomaly"
 KSP_mun_category_desc: "Preliminary scans of [Root.GetName] suggest there may be a very unusual structure on the surface of the moon. A team could be sent down to the surface to take a closer look."
 KSP_moho_category: "The Pole of [Root.GetName]"
 KSP_moho_category_desc: "Whilst passing in orbit over the precise location of the north pole of [Root.GetName], the scanners detected an inexplicable sudden change in the topography of the surface. A team has been prepared to investigate this anomaly."
 KSP_duna_category: "[Root.GetName] Anomaly"
 KSP_duna_category_desc: "An anomaly has been detected whilst orbiting over the red sands of [Root.GetName], initial reports suggest it is not a natural phenomenon."
 KSP_vall_category: "[Root.GetName] Anomaly"
 KSP_vall_category_desc: "Although only a small icy moon, [Root.GetName] appears to have a most unusual structure on its surface. Initial readings coming to the ship suggest some sort of construct not seen in nature."
 KSP_ike_category: "A Strange Orbit"
 KSP_ike_category_desc: "Whilst in high orbit over [Root.GetName], the ship has picked up readings of a most unusal nature. A small object of roughly one hundred cubic metres is in a very low, and perfectly circular, polar orbit around the moon."

 KSP.3.name: "The UFO"
 KSP.3.desc: "As the [Root.GetName] approaches the anomalous object on [From.GetName] it became apparent that we are not dealing with a natural formation. It is a crashed ship, disc shaped and of pure shiny grey colour. It is half embedded in the rocky surface, perhaps crashed landed there. We will never know for sure how it got there, but we have gained some useful knowledge from our investigation of the object."
 KSP.3.a: "Who left it there?"
 KSP.4.name: "The Arches"
 KSP.4.desc: "The team of scientists led by [Root.GetLeaderName] landed beside the structure on [From.GetName]. They report it is a great arch, made from the same grey rocky material as found on the rest of the surface. Many in the scientific community do not believe it can be a natural feature, and that it must be an alien construct, others put it down to a fluke of nature."
 KSP.5.name: "The Monolith"
 KSP.5.desc: "[Root.GetLeaderName] discovered the structure on [From.GetName] to be more remarkable than first thought. It is a great monolith, tall and made of smooth metal. Inscribed upon it is the the head of some alien creature, and what appears to be a word in an indecipherable language. We are at a loss to think of who put it there."
 KSP.7.name: "The Mohole"
 KSP.7.desc: "[Root.GetLeaderName] had the [Root.GetName] land near the surface anomaly on the north pole of [From.GetName]. The survey team report it to be a sinkhole some 4.6km deep. It is very narrow and white on the inside, and tapers to a point with increasing depth. Anomalous forces are present around its rim, leading scientists to question whther it is a natural feture. In any case our study of the feature and its physical properties has benefitted our understanding."
 KSP.9.name: "A Strange Face"
 KSP.9.desc: "The anomaly detected on [From.GetName] was been discovered by [Root.GetName]'s surface team to be a very large monument carved out of the red rock of the planet's surface. Most perplexingly, it carved in the likeness of a [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] face! Our scientists are at a loss to explain how this happened, insisting that no [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] has been known to set foot on [From.GetName] before now."
 KSP.9.descB: "The anomaly detected on [From.GetName] was been discovered by [Root.GetName]'s surface team to be a very large monument carved out of the red rock of the planet's surface. Perplexingly, it carved in the likeness of a species of aliens found on the nearby planet [kerbin.GetName]. Our scientists are at a loss to explain how this happened, insisting that these creatures are not known ever to have invented space flight."
 KSP.10.name: "The Signal"
 KSP.10.desc: "The anomaly detected on [From.GetName] has been discovered by [Root.GetName]'s surface team to be a pyramid shaped hill. The ship was drawn to the hill by a feint primitive SSTV being emitted by the hill, the source of which is hundreds of metres below the surface. The signal has been decrypted, and it shows a diagram-like image of three figures standing next to the hill itself, perhaps implying that [From.GetName] was once inhabited or visited before?"
 KSP.11.name: "The Henge"
 KSP.11.desc: "The [Root.GetName] has landed on the icy surface of [From.GetName] near the anomalous structure. [Root.GetLeaderName]'s team reports it to be a circular formation of stone blocks, the likes of which can be compared to the ancient henges found on [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] built by our primitive ancestors. Scientists can only guess at how such a structure can end up on a frigid, frozen moon such as [From.GetName], and will probably never discover why."
 KSP.12.name: "The Magic Boulder"
 KSP.12.desc: "[Root.GetLeaderName] had the [Root.GetName] match its orbit with the mysterious object orbiting [From.GetName], ready to take readings from it. Visual observations revealed it to be a dark grey boulder with green bands, and a green glow indicating it may be radioactive. Instruments also indicated a very abnormal gravitational field, and so [Root.GetLeaderName] took caution and sent unmanned probes to investigate further. \n\nThe first appeared to dig into and pass through the surface with no ill effect, another spontaneously exploded only metres away from the surface. Needless to say no-one went any closer to the boulder, now dubbed by the team as the 'magic boulder', and were content to gain knowledge from observations at a safe distance."
 KSP.13.name: "The Magic Boulder"
 KSP.13.desc: "[Root.GetLeaderName] had the [Root.GetName] match its orbit with the mysterious object orbiting [From.GetName], ready to take readings from it. Visual observations revealed it to be a dark grey boulder with green bands, and a green glow indicating it may be radioactive. Instruments also indicated a very abnormal gravitational field, and so [Root.GetLeaderName] sent a small team to do a primary surface investigation.\n\nAlarm was first caused when the survey ship appeared to dig into and pass through the surface with no ill effect, and when a second landing was attempted the ship spontaneously exploded only metres away from the surface. Needless to say no-one else went any closer to the boulder, now dubbed by the team as the 'magic boulder', and were content to gain knowledge from observations at a safe distance."
 KSP.14.name: "The Magic Boulder"
 KSP.14.desc: "[Root.GetLeaderName] had the [Root.GetName] match its orbit with the mysterious object orbiting [From.GetName], ready to take readings from it. Visual observations revealed it to be a dark grey boulder with green bands, and a green glow indicating it may be radioactive. Instruments also indicated a very abnormal gravitational field, but [Root.GetLeaderName] decided to try and land [Root.GetName] on it anyway.\n\nAlarm was first caused when the ship appeared to dig into and pass through the surface with no ill effect, and when a second landing was attempted the ship spontaneously exploded only metres away from the surface. [Root.GetLeaderName] and their crew have all been lost."
 KSP.16.name: "[From.GetSpeciesName] Space Program"
 KSP.16.desc: "The native [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] of [From.Capital.GetName] have recently been observed by our research team there to have started a space exploration program. At first our scientists put their ill-judged and poorly planned missions to be down to inexperience and lack of knowledge. However the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have been persisting with crazy rocket designs that either explode on the launch pad, or spontaneously disassemble before reaching orbit. Many [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] can also be found lost and abandoned in orbit, having run out of fuel during their haphazard missions, although still with serene grins on their faces.\n\n Watching transmissions of these amusing failiures has become a favourite pastime of the scientists stationed there, indeed even back home on [Root.Capital.GetName] viewing these transmissions of stupid alien antics has become a popular sensation."
